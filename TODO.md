## TODO

- [ ] Ability to switch between databases

- [ ] Make results table rows sortable

- [ ] Support --password or PGPASSWORD (like PGADMIN)

- [ ] Allow to start the app without connecting, and offer a login
      page in the Web UI with login/pass/db, etc..

- [ ] Allow connecting with only login/pass, and list things to
      connect to afterwards

- [ ] Remove --user, --pass and only ask for --url to start with.
      Having both is confusing right now.
