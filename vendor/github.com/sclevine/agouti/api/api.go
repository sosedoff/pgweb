// Package api provides a generic, low-level WebDriver API client for Go.
// All methods map directly to endpoints of the WebDriver Wire Protocol:
// https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol
//
// This package was previously internal to the agouti package. It currently
// does not have a fixed API, but this will change in the near future
// (with the addition of adequate documentation).
