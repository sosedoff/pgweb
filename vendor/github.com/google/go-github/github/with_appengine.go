// This file provides glue for making github work on App Engine.
// In order to get the entire github package to compile with
// Go 1.6, you will need to rewrite all the import "context" lines.
// Fortunately, this is easy with "gofmt":
//
//     gofmt -w -r '"context" -> "golang.org/x/net/context"' *.go

package github

import (
	"context"
	"net/http"
)

func withContext(ctx context.Context, req *http.Request) *http.Request {
	// No-op because App Engine adds context to a request differently.
	return req
}
